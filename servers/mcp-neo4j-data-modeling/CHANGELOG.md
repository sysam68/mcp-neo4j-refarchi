## Next

### Fixed

### Changed
* Update base image in Dockerfile to `python:3.13.8-slim`

### Added
* Add tool annotations for all tools - readOnlyHint, destructiveHint, title, idempotentHint, openWorldHint

## v0.8.2

### Fixed
* Fixed bug in f-string formatting with Pydantic model export in Python v < 3.12
* Fixed bug in the data modeling Github action that didn't actually test different Python versions due to not specifying the version when executing uv commands.
* Fix Github action to install dev dependencies correctly with uv sync

### Changed
* Update `pyproject.toml` to declare dev dependencies correctly (previously using deprecated method)

## v0.8.1

### Fixed
* Shorten tool name `export_to_neo4j_python_graphrag_package_schema` to `export_to_neo4j_graphrag_pkg_schema` to be under 60 characters including the default server name.
* Shorten tool name `load_from_neo4j_python_graphrag_package_schema` to `load_from_neo4j_graphrag_pkg_schema` to be under 60 characters including the default server name.

### Added
* Update README to include new tools and optional `return_validated` argument to validation tools

## v0.8.0

### Fixed
* Remove `stateless_http` flag on MCP server constructor and move to the appropriate `run_...` function for http and sse transport. The constructor flag is deprecated by FastMCP.
* Removed `dependencies=...` from server constructor. This was removed from FastMCP.

### Changed
* Make node corners rounded for Mermaid visualization

### Added
* Add methods to export schema as string representations of Pydantic models for `Node`, `Relationship` and `DataModel`
* Add tool that exports data model as a string representation of a Python file containing imports and Pydantic models
* Add methods to import and export as Neo4j GraphRAG Python Package schema JSON for `Node`, `Relationship` and `DataModel`
* Add tools that import and export data model as Neo4j GraphRAG Python Package schema JSON
* Add `description` field to `Node` and `Relationship` classes
* Add docstring to generated Pydantic nodes and relationships based on `description` field

## v0.7.0

### Fixed
* Fix bug in Dockerfile where build would fail due to `LABEL` statement coming before `FROM` statement

### Changed
* Tools that received Pydantic objects as arguments now also accept JSON strings as input. This is for client applications that send JSON strings instead of objects for tool arguments. This is a workaround for client applications that don't adhere to the defined tool schemas and will be removed in the future once it is not needed.

### Added
* Added JSON string parsing utils function. This is for client applications that send JSON strings instead of objects for tool arguments. This is a workaround for client applications that don't adhere to the defined tool schemas and will be removed in the future once it is not needed.
